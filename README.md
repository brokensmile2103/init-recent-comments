## Overview

**Init Recent Comments** is a lightweight, developer-oriented plugin that displays the latest comments anywhere on your site through a simple shortcode.

Built with flexibility and simplicity in mind — clean markup, minimal CSS, and template overrides directly from your theme.

Ideal for blogs, news sites, or any project that values both performance and clean design.

## Features

- Shortcode: `[init_recent_comments]`
- Template-based rendering (`comment-item.php`, `wrapper.php`)
- Disable built-in CSS and use your own styling
- No widgets, no jQuery, no frontend dependencies
- Developer-ready — filters, REST endpoints, and lazy loading (planned)
- Translation-ready (`.pot` file included)

## Usage

Use the shortcode anywhere:

```shortcode
[init_recent_comments number="5" maxheight="400px"]
```

**Attributes:**
- `number` – Total comments to display (default: 5)  
- `maxheight` – Optional scrollable height (e.g. `300px`)

**Template overrides:**
Place custom templates inside your theme:

```
your-theme/
└── init-recent-comments/
    ├── wrapper.php
    └── comment-item.php
```
